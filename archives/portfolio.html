<p>Howdy! My name is Ardecai (real name redacted for obvious reasons)</p>
<p>I am currently learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript</p>
<p>I also have experience in Python and Cybersecurity for 3 years!</p>
<p>My portfolio, perhaps, is not in its aesthetic state so I'll continuously work on improving my portfolio</p>
<p>I will also be sharing my past and future projects in my programming journey in my github account</p>
<p>So stay tuned!</p>

<p>I also want to say "thank you!" to SuperSimpleDev for kickstarting my journey in web development</p>
